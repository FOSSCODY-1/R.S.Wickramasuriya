        <p>In this game there's a grid of 3 by 3 squares. This is a two player game. Each player is automatically assigned to a symbol(Cross of Nought). Players can fill the empty squares by the assigned symbol one after the other. Each players target is to make a straight line of his/her own symbol. It can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. The first player to make that straight line will be the winner.</p>  
        <br>
        <p>There is two modes in this game. You can either play Multiplayer with a friend or you can play Singleplayer. Enjoy!</p>
